### When Design Meets Disability

"Design depends largely on constraints" 

I was particularly inspired by this phrase because we tend to underestimate what design can bring into our world. As a Visual 
Arts major, I have been too focused on design as something visually attractive- typography and layout in graphical sense. 
However, this reading gave a deeper insight to design in a broader term. For example, it was interesting to read about how
fashion and disability overlap in the sense that we wear glasses sometimes to assist with our eyesights but also as a mode
of fashion. As a person who has been wearing glasses for almost half of her life, I have never considered my bad eyesight as
something embarassing or something to hide about; I remember watching TV a few centimeters away just to make my eyesight bad so
I could convince my parents to get a pair of glasses for me. Although I have never thought of why I had such positive encounter (?)
or perception about glasses, reading this made me realize how important social norm is. "Spectacles have evolved from medical
aids to fashion accessories" and it had become a social norm to consider it as a part of fashion than a medical device. 
Although a variety of choices can be made in regards to wearing glasses that are available in different designs or even
contact lenses for people who don't like the idea of wearing spectacles, I also thought it would be wonderful to have these kinds
of choices in a lot of the examples given in the reading, such as the hearing aids, prosthetics arms and legs, and etc. 

Furthermore, I liked how the writer distinguished between the words like glasses and eyewear. As much as the word- eyewear, sounds
more 'trendy', I began to appreciate how words can change people's perception and perspective. One example of this would be
calling 'disabled' people as 'people of determination'. Although they may refer to the same people, the connotations are very 
different. I hope we become more sensitive to how we label objects and refer to people in the future.
