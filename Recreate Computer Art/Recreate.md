### Recreating Computer Art

Before realizing that the assignment was to recreate any of the works in the pdf with out own interpretation, I thought Computer GRAPHICS and ART for May. 1978 was the easiest for me to tackle.
Since I was new to processing, I felt the repeated lines would be a good start to practicing for loops. 

My overall plan for this assignment was to use the for loops to create rectangles and hardcode their positions into place by 
constantly checking and changing the numerical values. In the beginning it worked fine; I screenshotted the image onto my ipad 
so I could color bits and pieces off of the image to confuse me less.
Some parts of the horizontal lines were on top of the vertical lines and vice versa so I had to check the positions each time which was extremely time consuming.

After we had the short lesson on Monday and practiced using the random and noise function by recreating a broken computer screen,
I used the code to randomly assign positions of several lines in the given width and height. But for me, since I had completed
80% of the work by hardcoding and creating an exact copy of the image in the catalog, it didn't seem to blend in nicely with the rest of the image.
Hardcoding helped me get my head around how coding works and how the image is produced, but I found it extremely difficult to go back
and edit some of the numbers because I had a long list of for loops and I had no idea which one was which.

I think I kind of learned to code more effectively as I worked on this assignment because towards the very end, I figured out that
several rectangles can be produced at different positions within a single for loop (I had copied pasted the for loop over and over 
again to duplicate the rectangles and change their positions).

I also thought that making void horizontal_rectangle (x,y) {, void vertical_rectangle(x,y){ etc. and reusing these into my coding to recall the rectangles into the for loops would 
have been much easier than creating countless for loops with the same principle and idea but different numbers.
I was also very confused with what a specific value does inside the bracket; it took me some time to learn what goes in rect(float,float,float,float) for example.

This assignment taught me not to be so dedicated to coding as in, I will not think from now on, that hardcoding is easier than an effective
coding for the sake of taking an easier route. However, it did feel like I was learning because I understood more as I coded and
this helped me get my head around other possible ways to tackle the problems.
