### What does computing mean to me at this point?

Computing means a lot to me at this point. Before committing to this class, I had actually taken Intro to Computer
Science during the first semester of my freshmen year. However, I had faced a lot of difficulties understanding
and had come to the point of giving up on learning more. I have always thought that coding was not for me and only special
people who have the brains to understand coding could take on coding courses offered on campus. However, just last semester,
I went to the IM Showcase for the first time and was so mesmerized by the outcomes students had produced; this motivated me
to try learning code languages from scratch and actually challenge myself to try again. 

Debugging and writing codes that do what I want always takes me days and days. I remember struggling so much on the OOP assignment
and just as I was about to give up, I actually saw what mistakes I had made and how a single line of code could fix the 
whole program. I wouldn't say the weekly assignments were chill and easy, but they have definitely pushed me further and expanded my coding skills and knowledge. (Plus I love the feeling of getting something to work after being stuck on it for several hours) 


Not only this, the readings about designs and codes that had changed the world inspired me in ways that motivated me to learn
more and more. They also taught me endless opportunities computing can provide. As a person who is passionate about design,
this course helped me explore the broader sense of what designs can offer from simply creating something from my imagination
and mind, to physical designs that become a part of someone's life forever. I wouldn't exaggerate that this course actually
helped me see the potential of what I may be capable of, and that I will be taking 2 coding classes next semester in NY. I would
have never imagined myself taking these classes but as much as I have experienced how much computing can provide a solid
base to creations, I feel that I am becoming more engaged to it than I was ever before.

What do others get out of my relationship with computing?

I'm not sure, but since I'm still at the beginner's stage, I hope I can continue to learn and look back at today, and 
thank myself for not giving up!
