# self portrait blog post

Brief:

Make a self portrait (doesn't have to be dynamic) using Processing

Description:

I made an image of myself looking outside the windown during a light snowfall.

Problems:

I have never regretted so much for cutting my fringe before this assignment; I wanted my eyebrows to show through my fringe
and I tried using beginContour() and endContour() to crop out two triangles off of a fringe I created by combining an ellipse 
and a rectangle but I had trouble doing so. Instead, I created separate shapes and translated them into place which took a lot
of time. 

I spent a lot of time trying to change every single value of the location of shapes whenever they weren't in place, but I found out towards the end that I could have just used translate() to move several shapes around the canvas all together.
