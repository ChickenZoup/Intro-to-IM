The reading gave me detailed insights to how computer is programmed to produce video art and interactive pieces as early as
the 1990s. There were a lot of technicalities in the reading by showing examples of projects and a list of functions with
brief descriptions of how the code is implemented and to my surprise they were remarkably simpler than I thought.
Since I am still a beginner in codes and computer science, I tend to complicate my codes; it is almost impossible for me to think
of a more effective and a simpler way of putting them together which is why I have a hard time debugging if the program doesn't
run as expected. This question is more for me- is there a way to improve our way of thinking? What factors do we have to consider
when designing a program so that lines of codes can be minimized but functions efficiently?

Although we tend to think computers are more superior and advanced than humans, the fact that it was the humans who built in codes
and programs for computers to function is significant. Since scientists are researching ways to recreate a human robotic form that can
think, talk and show diverse face expressions, I wonder if it will ever be possible or even ethically acceptable to dehumanize
every aspects that make us humans into simple lines of codes.
 Also, as much as computing is developing and expanding to medical sectors,
commercial sectors and private sectors, it is becoming a part of us that we cannot live without.
I feel that we are being more and more dependent on the techonology we have developed which
could potentially improve the qualities of our lives, but it is worrisome if we were to leave our decisions solely to computers.

As much as our lives depend very much on computers and programs, is it okay to leave the boundaries of humans and computers
to merge? Are we dehumanizing ourselves by converting everything into lines of codes or are we humanizing codes by letting them
perform actions that only humans could?
