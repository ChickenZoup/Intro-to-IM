### Data Visualization

I came up with my own piece of data because I didn't want to confuse myself with a long list of numbers (and it's also easier
to debug). The visualization is that the size of the cirlces are relative to the numerical data I set. Similarly, when the
mouse is clicked rectangles spring up from the screen. Although in the coding, I set the size of the rectangles relative to the
data, I also multiplied it by a range of numbers so this doesn't directly reflect the numerical data sets as accurately as the
circles.

Also, I mapped MouseX to fit the screen so that the horizontal movement of the mouse changes the color of the cirlces and rectangles.
