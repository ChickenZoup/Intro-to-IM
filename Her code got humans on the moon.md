# Her code got humans on the moon

Although I am not an expert in coding, I have the tendancy to assume that the worst won't happen; I leave my destiny up to
the users/ professors to not go beyond what I had planned or had in mind. Reading about Hamilton and her persistence to get
every little steps secured and debugged made me guilty and embarassed for even attempting to stand above users. I was also
well motivated to consider every assignment and projects as something professional and not a one-time event that will go away
next semester. 

As a student who is still exploring specific areas of interest and careers that are well suited for me, the reading reminded
me of how wonderful and rewarding it is to be fully invovled and passionate in subjects that I love. Hamilton's passion and 
perseverance that shone among many other talented male workers in a male-dominated working field in the 1960s should be respected
and applauded for, and the whole idea of 'domination' of a certain sex in a certain working field makes me wonder how much of a
talented workforce we would have if the working environment was less about the prejudice and underrepresentation but more about
inclusion and evenness.
